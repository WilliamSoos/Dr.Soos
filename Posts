## A Little Look Into Who I Am
### By William Soos

Hi! I’m William Soos and I’m a junior from Buffalo, NY. I'm majoring in Finance and minoring in Leadership studies and Military Science. On campus, my main engagements are with ROTC, the Captains Educational Enrichment Fund (CEE Fund), and managing the Women’s Soccer Team here at CNU. Choosing to leave home and go to college in Virginia was a bit of a transition, but I’ve been more than happy with my decision thus far.

Change is something I’ve never feared, and I think that comes from growing up in a military family. Originally born in Seattle, I moved to Illinois and then to Buffalo where I have spent 17 years of my life. Growing up my parents preached the importance of *new experiences* and *putting yourself out there*. They also taught my brothers and I the importance of *giving back*. I think part of this mentality comes from the culture of the Military, as well as understanding that there are less fortunate people in the world.

Leaving highschool I had two big decisions to make. Where to go to school and what career do I want to pursue. When trying to make these big decisions, I always caught myself coming back to my parents' advice. One of the reasons I chose CNU was the ideal of selfless service that they promote so heavily. I think you become who you surround yourself with, and I wanted to be in a community of people looking to impact the world.  

This mentality also played heavily into my decision to accept a national scholarship for Army ROTC. Maybe growing up in a Military family played into it, but I’ve always felt the somewhat cliche “call to service”. No matter how many times I considered other career paths, I always found myself wanting to serve our country for a portion of my life. 

While I know that the next decade or so of my life will be focused on the Army, a career in the private sector has always interested me and I will most definitely make that transition at one point in my life. 

After my time in the Army, I hope to pursue a life of business. Not one that consists of working 9-5 in a cubicle, but rather one where I have the ability to impact the lives of others. I aspire to either own my own company or work my way into the leadership of an existing company with my dream position being CFO. While I understand the importance of every position in an organization, my experiences have taught me that those at the forefront of an organization are those that can truly make change. I want to be that individual. 

This whole blogging thing is something I’ve never done and I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't do it entirely right, but I feel like an appropriate way to end a piece like this is with some advice. So here’s mine.   

1. Embrace Change
2. Chase Your Passions
3. Help Others Along The Way
4. **Never** forget those that helped you get to where you are
