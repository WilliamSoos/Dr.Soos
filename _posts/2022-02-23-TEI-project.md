# My Oxygen Experience
## By William Soos

For this assignment, I was given the opportunity to encode a portion of page 16 and 17 of Bram Stoker’s “*Dracula’s Guest*”. Stoker's piece shared the stories of a traveler's mysterious encounter with the mysterious woods, home to Dracula. The purpose of this assignment was to markup the text using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and standardized eXtensible Markup Language (XML) introduced to us. Through doing so, we look to expand our understanding of the digital humanities world and its impact on timeless works of literature.


## **Markup**
We began the assignment by identifying our individual portion of Stoker’s work. With Professor Stover already breaking the sections up for us, our next step was to begin analyzing our text by marking it up. We searched our passages for various tags such as titles, page beginnings, section breaks and more. My section was relatively straightforward, including a page beginning, numerous paragraph tags, and a handful of quotes.

Utilizing the comments feature on Google Docs, seen above, was extremely helpful. This gave me a visual guide as to what tags I’m responsible for coding later on in our assignment. While confusing at first, the markup portion of this assignment turned out to be simple and acted as a great reference for the later portion of this assignment.

## **Oxygen and XML**
Just from the looks of it, coding has always been an intimidating process to me. I’ve never fully grasped the concept; however, using Oxygen was an extremely informing experience. As we progressed through the TEI project I most definitely noticed a strong development in my comfort and understanding of coding. 

The in-class instruction provided useful insight on the steps of coding and how to implement necessary tags. While confusing at first, I eventually understood how and where to include my necessary tags seen below. This is largely due to the guidance and assistance Professor Stover provided me during class. At this point I was pretty sure I completed the code correctly, but I still had a daunting concern that it wasn't right.

I expressed this concern and Professor Stover told us about a tool that removed all my worries: the author’s view on Oxygen. This feature is a great addition as it allows for you to view the actual structure of your code. Removing all of the intimidating lines of code and presenting the text in its basic format removed my doubts and I finally felt content with my work.

Overall, I found this project to be a great experience. I was overwhelmed when it was first mentioned, but as we moved through the project I realized it's a very straightforward process that just requires attention to detail. The guidance provided by Professor Stover and useful tools within Oxygen really allowed me to further my familiarity and comfort with coding. The TEI project was a great way to demonstrate how old pieces of literature can be rejuvenated through the art of the digital humanities.
