**A Review of *Placing Segregation* ** 
**Project:** *Placing Segregation*
**Project Manager:** Robert Shepard
**Project URL:** https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/placingsegregation/

##**Summary** 
*Placing Segregation* is a depiction of the societal injustice present in America during the late 1800’s. Specifically, this project highlights the issue of residential segregation. This matter contributed to creating a land of unequal opportunities for people of color as well as the minority population. 

In this project, Robert Shepard gives readers the ability to explore the historical residential segregation of three locations: Omaha, Nashville and Washington. Through the usage of this simplistic, interactive interface, Shepard hopes readers will gain a visual understanding of the issue.

This Digital Humanities work gives users the opportunity to sort by filters such as race, wealth, and ethnicity to gain a tailored understanding of the times and allow for specified analysis on the issue of residential segregation in the late 1800’s. The blue dots symbolize the residence of every individual identified on a census between years 1850-1870.

##**Design**
*Placing Segregation* was written with free open source components and constructed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript functions. This interface was designed simply to promote long term compatibility as well as wide-spread usability. This design ultimately created a source accessible across both mobile and desktop platforms. 

##**Findings**
The layout of Placing Segregation is extremely simple. Each tab is free of unnecessary additions that may distract a user's attention from the topic at focus. The site is very informative and a great resource, but with a few adjustments Robert Shepard may be able to improve his project's effectiveness even more.

###***Washington, Nashville, Omaha* Sections**
These interactive maps are a great way to present information visually. The zoom feature gives users the ability to examine the segregation of the city from a bird’s eye view all the way down to a specific street. Including this allows for readers to actually see how individuals were being segregated.

To strengthen the impact of these maps, it could be beneficial to include variables such as income and population numbers into these sections. Using a tool such as a heat map that breaks down where the wealth was in these cities would be useful in understanding residential segregation. Doing so highlights how these minorities were excluded from the hearts of society and were left to fend for themselves in the outskirts of civilization.

###***About, Methods, Interpretations* Sections** 
Each extension is easy to work through and clearly defines what is being discussed. However, the actual information is written in wordy paragraphs that are too difficult to follow. 

Including subheaders in these sections would make the information much easier to read. When reviewing the site, I lost interest in the specifics simply because it was excessive. Paragraphs were too long and some sentences were written in different font sizes. Presenting these sections in a more visually appealing format can help readers understand their importance and increase the project's effectiveness.    

###**Interactive Map Filter** 
One of the best aspects of this project is its customization. Readers can come away with findings specific to their interests because the sidebar filter allows them to search for what they are interested in. The filters for race, ethnicity and working class highlight the residential segregation perfectly as they allow for users to visualize exactly how they were outcasted. 

Also on this filter is the ability to see the segregation on different types of maps and more modern ones. While this is a great idea, selecting these options does not alter the visual at all. The original historic option is the only one that actually works. This was pretty frustrating because I was interested to see how residential segregation impacted the development of society. This issue with the interface doesn't ruin the project, but it definitely limits its users ability to analyze the topic.  

###**Conclusion**
Overall, Robert Shepard did a great job with the construction of this project. It’s interactive design held my focus and provided me with the necessary resources to understand the true nature of residential segregation in the late 1800’s. Placing Segregation was a great depiction of how the Digital Humanities can accentuate an individual's ability to present and analyze information in a unique way.
