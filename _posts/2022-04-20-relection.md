# Reflecting on my Digital Humanities Journey 
## By: William Soos

*Writing for the Digital Humanities* was one of the most unique courses I have taken while at CNU. Coming into this semester I had no prior experiences in this field of study and truthfully didn’t even have a clue as to what the digital humanities were. I registered for this course because it seemed different from a traditional English class, and I can now say I was spot on with that assumption. 

Looking back, I would say I enjoy the contents of this class, but I definitely remember times throughout the year where I felt lost. This feeling wasn’t because of how the class was structured or taught, rather I think it was due to the fact that essentially every assignment was a new experience for me. Before this class I had never used GitHub (hyperlink), Oxygen (link), or written a grant. While lost at times, that feeling didn’t last very long because there were so many resources available to help us succeed. Below were the three that helped me the most throughout the semester. 

### 1. The Readings 
I found the readings to be a useful addition to the class. The fact that most of them were reasonable in length and also related to the material we were covering made them worth reading. I don’t think any of the posted readings were worth skipping, but I personally found some more serviceable than others. Interestingly enough, I think one of the most helpful readings was one of our first ones: [“What is Digital Humanities”](https://scholar.cnu.edu/ultra/courses/_796842_1/cl/outline) by Jason Heppler. As evident from my tweet below, this reading cleared up a lot of my initial confusion about what the Digital Humanities actually were and helped me come up with my own initial definition of the study: 

>DH is a vast study that allows individuals to question and analyze aspects of life through an inclusive, personal process.

### 2. Peer Review
I have never done peer review so frequently for a class, but I really enjoyed it for multiple reasons. It was super helpful having the opportunity to see how our classmates structured their work as well as get their feedback on our own writing. Getting a second set of eyes to review my work before turning it in helped me fine tune a lot of things I missed when reviewing with my own eyes. Also, the peer review template was a great tool to use for reviewing our peers' work, but I also really liked using it as a final checklist to ensure I completed everything before submitting. A maybe less obvious reason is that having peer review requires you to look at and work on your assignment a bit earlier than the due date. I, like many, tend to procrastinate but our peer reviews forced me to at least get a rough draft put together and get moving on the assignment as opposed to putting it off.

### 3. Dr. Stover
Regardless of which assignment we were working on, Dr. Stover was there to provide meaningful feedback on how to move forward. Rather than just saying something was wrong or didn’t look right, she would always give detailed advice about how to improve and upgrade my work. Looking back, my meetings with Dr. Stover during the early stages of the grant process proved to be the most helpful to me. This is because on multiple occasions she helped me narrow the focus of my grant and reassured me that I’m heading in the right direction, even when I didn’t feel like I was. Her willingness to help undoubtedly aided my development throughout the semester as I learned what it takes to create in the Digital Humanities. 

I could write for days about all of the resources that helped me throughout this semester, but these three were definitely the most significant to me. They not only guided me when I felt lost, but also helped me along my journey of understanding the Digital Humanities. 

This course was a really enjoyable experience and taught me so much about this interesting study. I’m grateful I took a leap and registered for *Writing for the Digital Humanities* as I truly believe this way of writing will be a focus of the future. 

To conclude this reflection and show the progression in my understanding of the Digital Humanities, I’m providing my final attempt at defining this study along with a visual, originally provided by Dr. Stover, that I now realize encapsulates the Digital Humanities perfectly.  

>DH is the integration of new technology to pre-existing studies to both pose and answer questions about modern times and the history that came before us.
